# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I'm currently working on: shipping robust, scalable WordPress platforms and high‑performance WooCommerce stores for businesses that need reliable growth-ready sites. I design and implement custom themes and plugins with a focus on maintainability, accessibility, and fast load times, and I architect integrations with third‑party services (payment gateways, headless frontends, CRMs). Alongside client work I'm building a portfolio of case studies that document technical decisions, performance improvements, and business outcomes so prospective partners can see the real value I deliver.<br><br>👯‍♂️ I'm looking to collaborate on: end-to-end e‑commerce initiatives, product‑led web experiences, and technical partnerships where WordPress is at the core of a digital product. I enjoy teaming up with product managers, designers, and growth teams to turn hypotheses into shipped features — from headless WordPress builds (React/Next.js) to custom subscription and marketplace models on WooCommerce. Ideal collaborations scale beyond one-off sites: long‑term improvements, platform migrations, and performance/UX roadmaps that increase conversions and reduce churn.<br><br>🤝 I'm looking for help with: product strategy and UX research to make customer journeys more compelling, growth marketing and analytics to measure impact, and warm introductions to e‑commerce teams or agencies seeking a senior WordPress developer. I also welcome design partnerships for crafting pixel‑perfect UI and research support for A/B testing and conversion rate optimization so technical work aligns tightly with commercial goals.<br><br>🌱 I'm currently learning: Pre‑Master’s MBA coursework to strengthen my business and strategy skills while I expand my technical stack into modern headless architectures. I’m studying product management practices, TypeScript + React for headless frontends, GraphQL, and advanced CI/CD patterns so I can deliver faster, safer deployments and better product outcomes. I’m also deepening my knowledge of performance engineering and scalable hosting patterns for WooCommerce at scale.<br><br>💬 Ask me about: building custom WordPress themes and plugins, WooCommerce architecture and checkout customization, PHP best practices, front‑end JavaScript and jQuery, Elementor and ACF workflows, headless WordPress patterns, site speed optimization, code review and maintainability, migrations, and how to align technical implementations with business KPIs. I can help audit codebases, propose architecture changes, or break down complex plugin logic into testable components.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: I combine technical delivery with business thinking — I study business while building WordPress solutions, which helps me translate product and marketing goals into pragmatic technical plans. I enjoy contributing to open‑source, mentoring junior devs, and finding elegant engineering solutions that actually move the business needle.
